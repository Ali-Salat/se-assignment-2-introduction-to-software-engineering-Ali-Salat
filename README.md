Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Deals with systematic application of engineering princples, methods and tools to develop and maintain with high quality software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Software engineering is a profession that involves different actors like developers, Clients, Quality assurance etc, to achieve the desired software solution development. it entails the use of best programming languages, Communicating with clients, Budgetting, Risk management, Resource allocation including time, graphic user interface designs, platforms, testing and maintenance, software and application updates or upgrades.

How does it differ from traditional programming? 
Traditional programmers were not all rounded in software engineering and only practice coding jobs. software Engineers formulate plans, they come up with the right programmers to do coding jobs, they do communication and follow up with clients and management, run troubleshooting, do software updates and upgrades, allocate budgettery allocations.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Is a process that makes high quality software solution within tight time schedule and budget constraints(cost effectiveness) that meets or exceeds clients demands.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Software Development Life Cycle has 7 phases;
Planning and analysis: feasibility studies are done on return on investments, total development cost, requirements of clients i.e end-users, clients  goals and project time to produce the final software product. In Waterfall approach high level of planning is required, whereas Agile model require minimal planning.
Define Requiements: raw data from phase 1 is converted for development team. producing guidlines such as software product specification.
Design: this phase entails designing of software design document, use of the right programming languages, platforms to use for teams collaborations, development of product prototypes.
Development: Division into software modules is done for coding team, the software development is done. Timeline is adopted to track progress. 
Testing: Internal teams like quality assurance is invited to do the following tests; performance validation, functional testing to see if it fits the desired job, usability tests, acceptance by end-users test and security tests.
Deployment: this is the implementation phase. the software product is delivered to the client for use.
Maintenance stage: further improvements are done in this stage, fixing of errors that were not detected in testing stage. Bugs fixing and updates are done in this stage.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall: its convinient where high level of planning and documentation is required and where the begining and ending is very clear.

Low level of clients and stakeholders involvement. No collaboration between teams since its done in stages.
sequential approach; completing each phase before moving to the next stage is done.
Its regid and not flexible as it follows predetermined plan.It does not accomadate change from customer. 
Detailed planning required; specifying all features and requirement upfront is required.
Risk Management: is done at the initial stage and not at all levels.
Documentation; extensive documentation required before commenment of project.
Easy Time and cost estimation.

Agile: its suitable where there is need for collaboration between the stakeholders for flexibility and adaptability.
Minimal planning is enough.
Division of the project into smaller manageable units.
Iterating and continues improvement is done.
Highly Adaptive & flexible.
Collaboration between stakeholders is done in all the stages.
High level client involvement.
continious Risk Management.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering: process of obtaining, identifying, analyzing, validating, and managing the needs of the client and users  for a software system.
Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle: see below for answers;
Its a foundation for a good design and development, improve quality by removing unneccessary data, reduce cost by removing inconsistencies early in the development lifecycle, helps in testing and maintenance, identifies potential risks in the development stage.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing: testing individual components or modules of software.

Integration testing:testing interactions between different modules or subsystems.

System testing: testing the entire software project as a whole.

Acceptance testing: testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Why is testing crucial in software development? it identifies and fixes errors early in the development stage making the software product higher in quality.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
What are version control systems? These are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members that maybe in different geoghraphical locations. 
Why are they important in software development? Its important as it enhances productivity and collaboration as team members in different geoghraphical locations can work in the same project making it efficient and effective in correction of errors in codes, lower cost of production and save time as project can be done throughout. 
Give examples of popular version control systems and their features: Git is an example of Version control systems. 

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Project Manager; leading the work of a team to achieve project goals within scope. ensures cost control, delivery in time, quality assurance, stakeholders satisfaction, resource management and risk management.
Software Project Manager oversees planning,execution and delivery of software.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
-Define software maintenance: Is the process of modifying and updating software after it was delivered to the client(user)

explain the different types of maintenance activities:
Preventive Maintenance: This include backup, optimization, restructing, updating documents, reviewing and testing. 
Adaptive Maintenance: modification to software arising from change of hardware or the the environment changes such as government policy and business rules.
patching: fixing unforseen future errors due to lack of impact analysis.
Corrective Maintenance: fixing bugs and errors in the software.
Perfective maintenance: Improving functunality, performance and reliability.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Data and System Security; preventing unauthorized, protecting sensitive data and encouraging Data security.
Reliability; prioritize continious uptime, stability and performance.
Transparency in privacy policy, honest communication about data usage. this creates accountability and trust among all stakeholders.
Compliance with relevant laws and industry standards.

Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
It secures development life cycle, this is done by integrating security practices at all levels in lifecycle.
Frequent security patches and updates to counter security vulnerabilities.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Unethical data collection; the organization should investigate and determine on its own.
Algorithm bias: Computers can bias if not checked properly. Software Engineers study current social norms and analyze their data.
Vulnerabitilities in Security; weakness arising from cyber attacks. Software engineers shall attend cybersecurity training to prevent cyber attacks.
wrong priorities; software engineers take alot of time in developing new features neglecting to improve on existing features
